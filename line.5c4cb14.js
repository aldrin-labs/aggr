const e="```ts\nline(data: number | {\n  value: number,\n  [time: number]\n}, [options])\n```\n\nRenders a line series.\n\n## Parameters\n\n- **`data`**: An object representing the line series data, containing **`value`** (the y-axis value). Optionally, **`time`** can also be included to specify the x-axis position.\n- **`options`** (optional): A set of styling options for the line series. Options include:\n  - **`color`**: The color of the line (e.g., `color='#2196f3'`).\n  - **`lineWidth`**: The width of the line in pixels (e.g., `lineWidth=2`).\n  - **`lineStyle`**: The style of the line, such as solid or dashed (e.g., `lineStyle=3`).\n\n## Returns\n\n- This function does not return a value. It renders the line series on the chart for the current bar.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe `line` function integrates with Lightweight Charts' `addLineSeries` to display data as a line chart. Each point on the chart represents a `value` at a specific `time`, and the points are connected by straight lines to visualize trends over time. This function is essential for displaying continuous data, making it suitable for various applications like financial analysis, scientific data representation, and monitoring system metrics.\n\n*Note: All options are optional. The function can be used with just the `data` parameter, applying default styles if options are not specified. The options must be valid CSS color values or appropriate numerical values for the function to render the series correctly.*\n\n\n\n\n\n";export{e as default};
